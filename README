Lambda JSON Library
-------------------

This library is mainly intended to be used with the Lambda OS build system to
parse configuration files, for kernel and module configuration in particular.
However, the intent was to make it generally useful in any application
requiring basic JSON parsing.

Missing features (not currently planned):
 - Escape sequences (e.g. \" or \033)
 - JSON generation
